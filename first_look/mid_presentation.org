* Introduction
K-NET and KiK-net are Japan's nationwide seismic networks.
They provide open strong-motion earthquake data for scientific and engineering purposes.

- Why earthquake data matters:
  - Disaster management
  - Building resilience
  - Seismic hazard analysis

K-NET -> Surface Stations
KiK-net -> Borehole Station (more complicated sensors)

* What is K-NET Data?
K-NET data comes in two main formats:
- **Binary format** (based on WIN32)
- **ASCII format** (simple text)

Each data record includes:
- Event origin information (time, location, magnitude)
- Observation station information
- Strong-motion waveforms (raw seismic acceleration)

* Accessing K-NET Data
- Main website: [[https://www.kyoshin.bosai.go.jp/]]
- Search by:
  - Event time
  - Magnitude
  - Epicenter location
- Download options:
  - Single-event download
  - Bulk download via database (advanced)

** TODO: Insert screenshot of search page and download buttons here

* Challenges Faced
- Website and documentation mainly in Japanese
- No "one-click" bulk download
- Manual navigation required
- Data formats require special understanding (BCD time format, WIN32 compression)

** TODO: Add brief comment about any issues you personally encountered

* My Workflow
- Studied the K-NET binary and ASCII format specifications
- Learned how to search and download events manually
- Set up basic batch download strategies (semi-automatic)

** TODO: Add screenshots of downloaded files or folder structure

* Example Event Downloaded
** TODO: Insert 1-2 examples (e.g., an earthquake you downloaded: date, magnitude)

** TODO: (optional) Plot one waveform in a simple graph (time vs acceleration)

* Research Questions

* Objectives

* Plan
