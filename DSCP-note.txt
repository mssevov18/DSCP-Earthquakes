Research Objectives:
Explore and understand the structure and accessibility of the NIED earthquake dataset.
Collect and preprocess earthquake data, including temporal, spatial, and magnitude attributes.
Develop visualizations to represent the spatial and temporal distribution of earthquakes in Japan.
Identify patterns or trends in earthquake frequency and intensity over time.


Research Questions:
What is the structure of the earthquake data provided by the NIED platform?
How frequently do earthquakes occur in different regions of Japan?
How does earthquake magnitude vary across time and geographic locations?
Can visual patterns reveal insights into regional seismic activity?
What visualization techniques are most effective for representing spatial and temporal earthquake data?
